- **Jan 2024**: Interested in making good decisions with conformal prediction? I'll give a virtual talk *"Selecting Trusted Decisions from AI Black Boxes: Correcting Conformal Prediction for Selective Guarantees"* at MLBoost ([event link](https://www.linkedin.com/events/selectingtrusteddecisionsfromai7141643577339564032/), Jan 4, 2024). This is based on our work on model-free selective inference [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01408), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09291)].

- **Oct-Dec  2023**: I'm presenting at  INFORMS Annual Meeting,  [WORDS 2023](https://sites.duke.edu/words2023/) at Duke University, [Rising Stars in Data Science Workshop](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/events/rising-stars-in-data-science-workshop-autumn-2023/) at UChicago, and "Causality, generalizability, and robustness" session at [ICSDS 2023](https://sites.google.com/view/icsds2023/home). 

- **Nov 2023**: Do you want to leverage auxiliary/unsupervised data to improve your (high-dimensional) prediction models? Check out our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10032) for our Modular Regression method, accepted at JMLR!

- **Sept 2023**: Our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14535) on graph conformal prediction is accepted at NeurIPS 2023 as a spotlight!

- **July 2023**: Our [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09291) on model-free selective inference is out! It develops new multiple testing techniques to deal with distribution shifts. I talked about this series of work [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01408), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09291)] at ICSA, JCSDS, and JSM.


- **June 2023**: My [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07015) on the Natarajan dimensions of popular function classes is accepted to ISIT 2023!
